I am working on a project based on the premise that in a time of polarization we need a new centre. Is anyone interested in participating? I am currently at the pre-organising phase. I have purchased newcentre.ca, the corresponding facebook and twitter handles. Right now it is about crowd-sourcing a coherent inclusive definition of what a "new centre" would look like and then coordinating a public speaking and workshopping event that hopefully will generate a first round of projects to work on.

Its goal directed action that sets the pragmatic frame for perception. Perception is a tool used to attain certain goals. It is not a way of dispassionately observing an infinite set of variables.

Defining what a "new centre" might look like - essentially it is not about left or right but agreeing upon a method to define problems using a common language and set of information and how we could solution generation would be better served by such a process - and secondly, holding an event where speakers and participates could try to live such a method and see where it leads. It's about viewing the world not so much as a competition of ideas but as cooperating network of them. I hope this will lead to a more inclusive intellectual space, where disagreement about the balance or moderation of competing values doesn't overshadow the common goals and desire of all humans.

I believe that in our current information age we have many opportunities for personal learning and growth and that these efforts would be better served if directly linked to communal learning and growth. I see it as an opportunity to harness one's already and preexisting and ongoing desire to learn with yet-unrealized opportunities for coordinated action.

I look forward to all criticism or compliments (bot about theory and more importantly about practical action-abilities) because I do not want to have to be smart or hard working enough to give birth to a fully coherent movement myself.
